Here are some suggestions and areas for improvement:

Complete the Stripe integration:

Implement the checkout process in your popup or a separate page.
Handle successful payments and update the user's subscription status.


Supabase Authentication:

Implement a sign-up and login process in your popup.
Update the background script to handle authenticated requests.


Update background.js:

Modify it to use Supabase for data storage instead of the current server setup.
Implement subscription checks before allowing premium features.


Error Handling:

Add more robust error handling in supabase.js and stripe.js.


Security:

Ensure that you're not exposing any sensitive keys in your client-side code.
Consider implementing server-side functions for sensitive operations.


Testing:

Add unit tests for your new Supabase and Stripe integrations.


Documentation:

Update your README.md file to include information about the Supabase and Stripe integrations.


Content Scripts:

Update your content scripts to check for subscription status before activating premium features.
